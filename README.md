# Path-Finding-Algorithms-Visualizer-Dijkstra-BFS-A*
The project set out to create an interactive visualizer using Pygame to demonstrate
and compare the functionalities of Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*
(A-star) algorithm for pathfinding. The primary objective was to provide a platform where
users could dynamically create custom grids, designate starting and target points, and
introduce obstacles, allowing for the real-time visualization of these algorithms in action. The
goal was to vividly illustrate and contrast the step-by-step processes of these algorithms as
they navigate through the provided grid, emphasizing their individual approaches in
determining the shortest path from the starting node to the target node. Dijkstra's algorithm
was expected to reveal its exhaustive exploration of potential paths, BFS its systematic
traversal of neighbouring nodes, and A* algorithm its ability to efficiently balance actual path
cost and heuristic estimated cost. The intention behind this interactive tool was to enable
users to observe and analyse how these algorithms tackle diverse scenarios, fostering a
comprehensive understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and distinct pathfinding
strategies. The overall aim was to create an engaging and educational environment that aids
users in comprehending the nuances and practical applications of these essential pathfinding
algorithms.
